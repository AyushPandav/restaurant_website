                    Origin Story
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Platera began as a humble dream, sparked by a family’s deep love for food and the joy of sharing it with others. What started in a small kitchen, experimenting with age-old recipes and modern twists, soon grew into a vision of creating a restaurant where every dish carries a story. The idea was simple – serve food that feels familiar yet inspires excitement in every bite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the passion grew stronger, so did the commitment to quality. Platera was built on the belief that food connects people, and that true hospitality comes from the heart. With carefully sourced ingredients, authentic flavors, and a dedication to culinary craftsmanship, our team set out to create more than just meals – we wanted to craft experiences worth remembering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Platera stands as a celebration of culture, flavor, and togetherness. From our signature platters to chef-inspired creations, every plate reflects our journey from a small dream to a destination for food lovers. While we’ve grown, our mission remains unchanged: to bring people closer through food that nourishes the soul and creates lasting memories.
